# ⭐ **Siraj’s Physics Logs**

### *A minimalist archive of my physics notes*

Welcome to my personal **physics knowledge base**, published through GitHub Pages and themed like a 25th-century science console. Each page is a self-contained, beginner-friendly deep dive into one major concept of modern physics.

More coming soon: Quantum fields, cosmology, dark matter, fusion physics, and whatever else I get obsessed with.

## 🧠 **Purpose**

I’m building this as:

* A **public notebook** for mastering modern physics
* A place to visualize the deepest concepts clearly
* A foundation for future videos and interactive tools
* A stepping stone toward a full Star Trek-style science database

Every page is intentionally written so a curious beginner can follow it, while still respecting the math and staying accurate.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

* **HTML** (hand-written, simple, future-proof)
* **CSS** (modern 2025 UI, neon/LCARS-inspired)
* **GitHub Pages** (automatic publishing)
* No JavaScript… yet. But interactive spacetime diagrams and quantum visualizers may appear.
